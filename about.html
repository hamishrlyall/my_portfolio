          <p>
            My name is Hamish Lyall, I am a Software Developer who recently
            completed a Diploma of Software Development at Swinburne University
            of Technology. In 2017 I completed a Certificate IV in Information
            Technology, the knowledge and experience I gained from that course
            gave me a fantastic starting point to advance my skills and
            understandings of the Software Development Industry. Over the past
            two years I have learned how to design and code software, analyse
            and determine client needs and business requirements, and
            succesfully manage and operate in a DevOps work environment. During
            this time I also spent some time working as a technical support
            officer at Pearson Australia. Here I helped users with a wide
            variety of issues they experienced using the software.
