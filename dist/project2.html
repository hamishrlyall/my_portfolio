          <p>
            The final major project of my Diploma was to create software for
            client, My School Remembers. I, and a team of other students were
            tasked with developing software that could be used by Year 9
            students to create biography slideshows of Australians involved in
            WWI. The students would use authentic records of historical
            documents from websites such as The AIF Project, The Australian War
            Memorial, the National Archives Australia and Trove in order to
            complete their profiles. The profiles would then be published and
            available for public viewing. For this project my team was tasked
            with producing a public view with multiple profiles of ANZACS that
            could be demonstrated to sponsors, schools and RSL's by Rememberance
            Day of 2018.

          <h3 class="text-secondary">The Solution</h3>
          <p>
            In order to achieve this my team put an extensive amount of time
            focusing on ensuring each profile was fully fleshed out with data
            gathered from the four aforementioned websites. We also had to
            ensure the views of each page were dynamic and responsive to
            different platforms, such as mobile, tablet, or widescreen. The
            profiles themselves were given the most attention and were completed
            with a profile picture, basic information, timeline, slideshow,
            coloured headings to indicate various life stages, and finally a map
            api with locations set to each slide. When showing our project the
            client was most impressed with the depth of our research on the
            subject, while demonstrating the program he spent an extended period
            of time reading each and every one of our profiles and playing with
            the functionality.
