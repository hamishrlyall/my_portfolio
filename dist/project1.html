          <p>
            This was the final project that had to be completed for the
            completion of my Certificate IV in Information Technology. For this
            project, we were given the challenge of programming a Lego
            Mindstorms EV3 robot to be able to go to a specific corner in a demo
            environment. These corners were based on colour, yellow and black,
            black and red, red and blue, and blue and yellow. To achieve this we
            had a robot we could program to move forward, turn and reverse as
            well as detect colour and distance. However, both of these sensors
            had limitations, the distance sensor had a minimum and maximum
            distance it could accurately detect and the colour sensor could only
            accurately detect the correct colour from a specific distance.

          <h3 class="text-secondary">The Solution</h3>
          <p>
            To overcome these limitations, my team decided to first limit the
            movement of the robot to small increments of a few centremeters at a
            time, after this command we set a command to detect distance, if the
            robot did not detect the distance we could accurately detect colour
            from the robot would make another movement forward. Between every
            movement we also added a command for the robot to sleep for one
            second, this made bugs much easier to detect and solve as we went.
            When the robot reached the distance to the wall where it could
            accurately detect colour we set the robot to make large or small
            turns based on the colour it detected and where it needed to be. If
            the robot needed to be in the Red and Black corner the robot would
            make a small turn left if it detected black, a small turn right if
            it detected red, a large turn right if it detected blue, and a large
            turn left if it detected yellow. You can see our robot in action in
            the video on the right!
