          <p>
            In the final challenge of my Diploma I was asked to develop
            a functional prototype in a six hour coding session. The protoype
            was required to fufill particular requirements. In the scenario we
            were given a local basketball league wanted a web application that
            team managers could use to create, edit and track fixtured matches, 
            venues, and booking costs. The app required OAuth so that the managers
            could log in using their google accounts and that the data would only
            be able to be viewed or manipulated by authorized users. Another 
            requirement was that the fixtures could be seperated into upcoming
            and past fixtures and that only past fixtures could have costs added.
            Lastly, it was required that the managers would have their total costs
            tallied and displayed next to their name.

          <h3 class="text-secondary">The Solution</h3>
          <p>
            In order to achieve this, I began by creating a database project with a
            'Managers' and 'Fixtures' table. I then created a ASP.Net Web application
            using Entity Framework and MVC to streamline the frontend development process.
            To achieve discrimination between upcoming and past fixtures I added two methods
            into my Fixtures Controller which would check if the current date was less or more
            than the date of each fixture, I then added views which would correspond with these
            parameters. To create functionality for users to add costs to past fixtures
            I simply removed the auto generated Update functionality from each page except my Past Fixtures
            page and to show the TotalSpent I added a method to my Managers View that would add the Fixtures
            Spent columns where the Managers Ids were the same. Finally, to implement the Authorization
            functionality I setup simple google Oauth which generated a new ASPNet database. I added the methods
            to all my controllers that would only allow Users to see the pages if their EmailConfirmed attribute
            was set to true. When new users were added this would automatically be set to 'false' and could then
            be changed by Authorized users in the ASPNetUsers view. To see these views click on the slideshow to the right.
